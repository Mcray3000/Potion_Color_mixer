## To Test Color Mixes

If you would like to test how the cauldron mixes colors and potentially create new potion recipes, visit the [Potion Brewing Color Mixer](https://potion-color-mixer.onrender.com/)!

To test a recipe that requires three ingredients, mix the first two ingredients together, then add the resulting mixture as the new first ingredient, followed by the catalyst.
