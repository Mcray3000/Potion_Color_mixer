## Potion Recipes and Colors
Each recipe can contain a maximum of three ingredients (Potions or Catalysts) in the cauldron at once, and the order in which the third ingredient is added always matters.

### 3 tiers of potions:

Beginner: *require one ingredient*   

| Potion | Recipe | Color Code |
|---|---|---|
| Red | Heartbeet | #FF0000 |
| Blue | Slimeblob | #0000FF |
| Green | Bones | #00FF00 |  

Intermediate: *require three ingredients (2 basic potions + a catalyst)*   

| Potion | Recipe | Color Code |
|---|---|---|
| Orange | Red + Green + Sunflower | #E79600 |
| Purple | Red + Blue + Lightning Bloom | #AB00E7 |
| Black | Green + Blue + Tar | #166060 |

Advanced: *requires three ingredients (2 intermediate potions + a catalyst)*   

| Potion | Recipe | Color Code |
|---|---|---|
| Gold | Orange + Purple + Sun Drop | #EF7D55 |
| Grey | Orange + Black + Sands of Time | #8B7F6E |
| Bomb! | Black + Purple + Gun Powder | #614F79 |

Unknown Potions: *A potion for which there is no existing recipe*

> For the potions with no effect, a suggestion would be to take the RGB values and, by whatever value is greatest, have a general mundane, slightly helpful, or slightly negative effect. The effect could even hint at what a real recipe might be.

## To Test Color Mixes

If you would like to test how the cauldron mixes colors and potentially create new potion recipes, visit the [Potion Brewing Color Mixer](https://potion-color-mixer.onrender.com/)!

To test a recipe that requires three ingredients, mix the first two ingredients together, then add the resulting mixture as the new first ingredient, followed by the catalyst.
